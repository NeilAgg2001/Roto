Cihan Altay created a Rotator Typeface in 2006.  It is a set of numerical glyphs which can be rotated 180 degrees and still remain readable as numbers.
The only thing I can find on it is this image:

I tried contacting the author several times via email and messenger, but received no response. I can only assume he has abandoned the project.

Therefore, I created this font to revive the project.
